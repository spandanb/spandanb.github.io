I've been drifting for many days now
I don't know if I've arrived
I thought there'd be albatross or something to indicate that I'm near
To soothe my scared little heart

I'm sure this will all make sense one day
I have a feeling
One day I'll look at these waters
And see past the chaos
See the gods dancing naked

Maybe one day I'll stop wandering.
Maybe I'll finally come back home
But the waters are treacherous and the path elusive
My only friend here is the moonlight
All the stories about the world I had heard, seem so true and yet so false
That's the thing with being out her,
You don't know where your mind ends and the waters begin
But until I figure that out I'll keep wandering
