Poetry quiets the Mind’s incessant need to be thinking,
To always be searching.


And not for a lost button, or the f#@!ing car keys,
But for the meaning of life
Of all things
Can you believe it?!
What do those words even mean?
Meaning?! Life?! F#@!
Far beyond me
So I write poetry
Absurdity in, nonsense out!
