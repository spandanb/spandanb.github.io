How daft and senseless the current situation
The time for action now
The space for time this
Fate as fateful it can be
And yet passing me by like sand in a stream, passes sand on the shore
Am I the totality of everything,
Or an obscure thought?


I do not fear God
I fear my death
I fear uncertainty
I fear suffering and loneliness
I subliminally fear the human condition
And I have created God to cope with my fears
To make sense of my imminent and inescapable awareness of my own completion
And if one stares into this abyss, one will be either insane or liberated


The weak spirit is impaled between the moment that passed and the moment to come
The awakened mind; the self of substance can withstand this moment
The weak spirit must live in atemporal memories of yesterday; prophecies of tomorrow
The  weak spirit creates Time to create space between itself and death;
Between itself and chaos;
Between itself and abyss;


Delusion!

One step, and I am become death
One breath, and I am become chaos
One moment, and I am become abyss


Why fear it?
When you look into my eyes, do you see anything but the deathless universe
Become a licentious bedfellow with these mistresses: death, uncertainty, loneliness
And you will see, whether you are the totality of everything, 
Or an obscure thought
