I have been here before.
<br>
I’ve seen this before.
<br>
This circle, I’ve been walking on
<br>
Feels like the circle I was walking before
<br>
<br>
One day, while I was circling,
<br>
A sage came and sat underneath a tree nearby
<br>
Not close enough to get in my way
<br>
Yet close enough to be seen
<br>
<br>
His presence was confusing
<br>
I found his meditative stillness calming
<br>
Yet, all I had ever known was circling
<br>
All I had ever seen was circling
<br>
A life without circling was unimaginable
<br>
<br>
And yet, here was a being free of circling
<br>
And having seen him, I felt like a fish who had seen water (and air)
<br>
I could and certainly would keep swimming
<br>
But I could not unknow what I now knew
<br>
<br>
Louise Erdrich best said what I was feeling:
<br>
Something shatters like ice
<br>
And we fall into the river of our own existence
<br>
We are aware
<br>
<br>
What is this circle to me?
<br>
And I, to it now?
<br>
Once I thought circle was all
<br>
I thought circle was life
<br>
And so circling was ennobling
<br>
<br>
But it is certainly not so
<br>
And this knowledge hollows the edifice of meaning
<br>
It seems to have taken the hues out of life.
<br>
I feel like protoplasmic fluid inside a pupa
<br>
Whether I will emerge or reduce to nothing, only time will tell
<br>
<br>
And now I am the timeless sea,
<br>
And now I am become death-
<br>
The destroyer of worlds
<br>
And now I am become Vishnu lying in the heavenly abodes
<br>
And now I am become the opening of Shiva’s third eye
<br>
And now I am become the totality of all beings
<br>
In me awakens, all that was, and all there ever will be
<br>
And now I am nothing.
<br>
