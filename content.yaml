    - title: Navigation System for the Visually Impaired
      link: https://github.com/spandanb/vis-imp-nav
      body: A navigation system intended to assist visually impaired users, 
            using a smartphone and a Microsoft Kinect.
            The smartphone''s magnetometer reading was used to determine which way the  
            user was facing. Additionally, Google Maps API was used to determine the route to the destination. 
            The Kinectic was used to determine obstacles and provide navigation at the micro-level.
            The smartphone provided haptic feedback informing the user whether they 
            should move forward, turn left, or turn right.

    - title: What is Data Engineering?
      link: https://hackernoon.com/what-is-data-engineering-5334cec027d0#.n00m10ouj
      body: A few months ago, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in data engineering.
            I was fascinated with data engineering because of all the big data tools being used,
            like Spark, but besides that, I knew very little. This is what I learned in the past 4 months.

      link: https://medium.com/@superspandan/cloud-computing-and-orchestration-d733de38fff9#.6mi8k2r9o
      body: For my masters thesis, I researched and prototyped a high level orchestration framework. 
            In this post, I will discuss the motivation for my project and the architecture and
            capabilities of the design and the prototype that was built.
